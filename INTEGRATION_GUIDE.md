# 🔗 Complete Integration Guide - CSV + Xero + Coupa

## 🎯 Overview

You now have a complete **multi-source data dashboard** that provides:

1. **📄 CSV File Upload** - Upload ledger data from CSV files
2. **🔗 Xero API Integration** - Connect directly to Xero accounting
3. **🏢 Coupa API Integration** - Connect directly to Coupa procurement
4. **👁️ Data Preview** - View and manage all imported data
5. **🔄 Reconciliation Engine** - Automatically match and reconcile data

## 📋 What's Been Created

### **Frontend Components**
- `LedgerLinkDashboard.js` - Main dashboard with navigation
- `CSVUpload.js` - CSV file upload with drag & drop
- `XeroIntegration.js` - Xero API connection (demo implementation)
- `CoupaConnection.js` - Coupa API connection 
- `CoupaDataPreview.js` - Preview Coupa data before importing
- `DataPreview.js` - View all imported data from all sources
- `ReconciliationDashboard.js` - Match and reconcile imported data
- All corresponding CSS files for styling

### **Backend Services**
- `coupaAuth.js` - Coupa API authentication
- `coupaService.js` - Fetch data from Coupa
- `coupaTransformer.js` - Transform Coupa data format
- `coupaIntegration.js` - API routes for Coupa
- `coupa.config.js` - Configuration settings
- Middleware and error handling

## 🚀 How to Use Your New System

### **Step 1: Update Your Main App**

Replace your current App.js with:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import LedgerLinkDashboard from './components/LedgerLinkDashboard';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <LedgerLinkDashboard />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### **Step 2: Add Backend Routes**

In your main server file (server.js or app.js), add:

```javascript
// Add this with your other route imports
const coupaRoutes = require('./routes/coupaIntegration');

// Add this with your other routes
app.use('/api/coupa', coupaRoutes);
```

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**

In your backend folder:
```bash
npm install axios
```

### **Step 4: Configure Environment Variables**

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and add your Coupa credentials.

## 📏 Data Flow

```
1. User imports data from any source (CSV/Xero/Coupa)
   ↓
2. Data gets transformed to common LedgerLink format
   ↓  
3. Data appears in "View Data" section
   ↓
4. User runs reconciliation
   ↓
5. System finds matches and discrepancies
   ↓
6. User reviews and approves results
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

### **Adding New Data Sources**

1. Create new component (e.g., `QuickBooksIntegration.js`)
2. Add to navigation in `LedgerLinkDashboard.js`
3. Follow the same pattern as Xero/Coupa integration
4. Transform data to common format

### **Modifying Reconciliation Logic**

Edit `ReconciliationDashboard.js` function `isMatch()` to customize how records are matched:

```javascript
const isMatch = (record1, record2) => {
  // Add your custom matching logic here
  // Example: match by amount + vendor + date
  return (
    Math.abs(record1.amount - record2.amount) < 0.01 &&
    record1.vendor === record2.vendor &&
    record1.date === record2.date
  );
};
```

### **Custom Data Transformations**

Modify the data transformation functions in each integration component to match your specific data format requirements.
