## 📦 Files Created (3 New Files)

## 🎯 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

### **The Magic Flow**

1. **You select AR or AP** (customer or supplier invoices)
2. **You choose Xero and load a customer** (e.g., "ABC Corporation")
3. **System checks**: "Does this customer have a linked counterparty?"
4. **If YES** → Special card appears! 🎉
   - Shows: "ABC Corporation is linked with ABC Supplier Portal"
   - You can click "Use Linked Account" → Data loads automatically!
5. **If NO** → Normal workflow (choose Xero or CSV manually)

### **Example Scenario**

Imagine you and your customer both use LedgerLink:
- You have them in your Xero as "ABC Corporation"
- They have you in their Xero as "Your Company Name"
- Someone creates a link between these two accounts
- **Now**: When you select ABC Corporation, the system says "Hey! They're linked! Want to load their data automatically?"
- **Result**: One click instead of multiple steps!

## 🧪 Try It Now (Demo Mode)

The feature is **live with demo data** so you can test it immediately!

### **Test Steps:**

1. **Go to**: https://ledgerlink.vercel.app/
2. **Navigate to** Matches page
3. **Select** "AR" (Accounts Receivable)
4. **Choose** "Xero" for Data Source 1
5. **Select one of these customers**:
   - **"ABC Corporation"** ← Has a mock linked counterparty
   - **"XYZ Ltd"** ← Has a mock linked counterparty
6. **Click** "Load Data"
7. **Watch** the special "Linked Counterparty Found!" card appear! 🔗
8. **Click** "Use Linked Account" to see it auto-load invoices
9. **Or click** "Choose Different Source" to use manual selection

### **What You'll See:**

A beautiful gradient card with:
- 🔗 Link icon
- "Linked Counterparty Found!" heading
- Customer and counterparty names
- Benefits list (automatic loading, real-time matching, saves time)
- "Connected" badge for Xero accounts
- Two buttons for your choice

---

## 🎨 Design

The card features:
- **Colors**: Primary blue gradient (#f0f7ff to #e0efff)
- **Professional**: Clean, finance-grade design
- **Clear**: Easy to understand what's happening
- **Actionable**: Clear buttons for next steps

## 🚀 What Happens Next (When You're Ready)

### **Phase 1: Backend API (Optional - Works Without It!)**

The frontend works with demo data right now. When you want real linked counterparties:

1. Create backend API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/counterparties/linked/:contactId`
   - `POST /api/counterparties/link`
   - `DELETE /api/counterparties/link/:id`
   - `GET /api/counterparties/search`

2. Store relationships in MongoDB

3. Frontend automatically switches from demo to real data!

### **Phase 2: Counterparties Management Page**

Build a page where users can:
- View all linked counterparties
- Add new links manually
- Remove existing links
- Invite counterparties to connect

### **Phase 3: Bidirectional Invites**

Allow users to:
- Send invites to counterparties
- Accept invites from others
- Build a network of connected accounts
