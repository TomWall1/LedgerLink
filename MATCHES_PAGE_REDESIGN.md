## üéì For Future Reference

### To Add More ERP Integrations (QuickBooks, SAP, etc.)

When ready to add other ERPs:

1. Update `DataSourceDropdown.tsx`:
   - Add new options like "Connected ERP - QuickBooks ‚úì"
   - Check connection status like we do for Xero

2. Create similar selector components:
   - `QuickBooksDataSelector.tsx` (copy pattern from `CustomerSelectorDropdown.tsx`)
   - Handle authentication and data fetching

3. Update `Matches.tsx`:
   - Add new data source types
   - Handle loading data from new ERPs

### To Implement Linked Counterparties

When backend is ready:

1. In `Matches.tsx`, add check for linked counterparties after Data Source 1 is loaded
2. If linked counterparty exists, show special card with "Use Linked Account" button
3. Auto-populate Data Source 2 when clicked

---

## ‚ùì Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Xero connection is working
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check that backend is running
5. Clear browser cache if needed
