3. **Generate API Key**
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Create new key named "LedgerLink Production"
   - Choose "Restricted Access"

   - **Copy the API key** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Add to Render (5 minutes)

   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Find your `ledgerlink-backend` service

2. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Go to Environment tab

   - Value: Paste your SendGrid API key
   - Click "Save Changes"

   FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
   FROM_NAME=LedgerLink
   ```

4. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Render will automatically redeploy
   - Check logs for: `✅ SendGrid email service initialized`

### Step 3: Test It (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://ledgerlink.vercel.app
2. Navigate to Counterparties page
3. Click "Invite Counterparty"
4. Select a contact from your Xero account
5. Enter your own email address to test

**Expected Result:**
You should receive a professional email with:
- LedgerLink branding
- Invitation code
- Working "Accept Invitation" button
- All formatting intact

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Arriving?

**Check Spam Folder First** - Initial emails often land in spam

**Verify Setup:**
1. Check Render logs for: `✅ Email sent to ...`
2. Confirm `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set in Render
3. Verify sender email in SendGrid dashboard
4. Check SendGrid Activity tab for delivery status

**Common Issues:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "The from email does not contain a valid address" | Verify sender email in SendGrid |
| "Forbidden" or "Unauthorized" | Check API key has Mail Send permission |
| Email in spam | Mark as "Not Spam" to train filters |
| No log messages | Backend might not have redeployed |

---

## Development Mode

**Without API Key:**
- Emails are logged to console
- Good for testing without sending real emails
- See full email content in backend logs

**With API Key:**
- Real emails sent via SendGrid
- Recipients receive actual emails
- Tracked in SendGrid dashboard
