# ERPConnectionManager Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides instructions for implementing the ERPConnectionManager component, which has been encountering issues due to a missing backend endpoint.

## Root Cause
The key issue is that the ERP connections routes are defined in `backend/src/routes/erpConnectionRoutes.js` but are never imported or mounted in the main `backend/index.js` file.

## Solution

### Backend Fix
Add the following code to `backend/index.js` in the appropriate locations:

```javascript
// Add with other route imports
import erpConnectionRoutes from './src/routes/erpConnectionRoutes.js';

// Add with other route mounting statements
app.use('/api/erp-connections', erpConnectionRoutes);
```

### Frontend Enhancements
The ERPConnectionManager component has been updated to handle the situation when the backend endpoint is not available:

1. **Mock Mode**: Added a fallback "mock mode" that works when the backend endpoint is unavailable
2. **Graceful Degradation**: If the endpoint returns 404, the component will automatically switch to mock mode
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better messaging and troubleshooting assistance for developers
4. **API Path Flexibility**: Attempts both '/api/erp-connections' and '/erp-connections' paths

## Implementation Steps

1. Apply the backend patch as shown in `backend/index.js.patch`
2. Update the frontend component with the changes shown in `frontend/src/components/ERPConnectionManager.jsx.changes`
3. Restart the backend server to pick up the route changes

## Mock Mode Features

In mock mode, the component:
- Stores connections only in local state (lost on page refresh)
- Shows a prominent "Demo Mode" banner 
- Still allows adding and removing connections
- Prevents navigation to connection details

This ensures the application remains functional even while the backend endpoint is being developed.
