# Customer Invoice Matching Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the customer invoice matching feature in LedgerLink. The feature allows users to select specific customers from Xero and match their invoices against CSV uploads or records from another company's ERP system.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced Transaction Controller**
   - Added `matchCustomerInvoices` endpoint to match Xero customer invoices with transactions
   - Added `approveCustomerMatch` endpoint to approve matches between invoices and transactions
   - Enhanced matching algorithm to calculate confidence scores based on multiple criteria

2. **Updated Transaction Routes**
   - Added new routes for customer invoice matching functionality:
     - `POST /api/transactions/match-customer-invoices`
     - `POST /api/transactions/approve-customer-match`

3. **Enhanced ERP Connection Controller**
   - Added `getXeroCustomers` and `getXeroCustomerInvoices` endpoints to retrieve customer data from Xero
   - Improved error handling and validation for ERP connections

### Frontend Changes

1. **New Customer Transaction Matcher Component**
   - Created `CustomerTransactionMatcher.jsx` for dedicated customer invoice matching UI
   - Implemented customer selection functionality
   - Added invoice display and matching interface
   - Integrated with both CSV and ERP transaction sources

2. **Updated API Utility**
   - Added transaction API methods for the new endpoints
   - Enhanced error handling and retry logic

3. **Navigation and Dashboard Integration**
   - Updated NavHeader with dropdown menu for transaction matching options
   - Added new route for customer transaction matching in App.js
   - Enhanced Dashboard with customer invoice matching card and quick action

## Feature Workflow

1. User navigates to the Customer Invoice Matching section
2. User selects a customer from their Xero account
3. System displays all outstanding invoices for the selected customer
4. User selects whether to match against CSV data or ERP data
5. System finds potential matches based on:
   - Amount matching (with tolerance for rounding)
   - Date proximity (configurable tolerance)
   - Reference/invoice number matching
   - Calculates a confidence score for each potential match
6. User reviews the matches and can approve or reject them
7. Approved matches update the transaction status in the database

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Matching Accuracy**: By focusing on a specific customer's invoices, the system can provide more relevant matches
- **Streamlined Reconciliation**: Allows for targeted reconciliation of specific customer accounts
- **Flexible Matching Sources**: Supports matching against both CSV uploads and other connected ERP systems
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides users with a numerical confidence level to help evaluate potential matches

## Future Enhancements

- Add batch processing for multiple customers at once
- Implement machine learning to improve match confidence scoring
- Add support for more ERP providers beyond Xero
- Enhance reporting on matched vs. unmatched invoices by customer
