# Homepage Redirect Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Summary
The homepage at https://ledgerlink.vercel.app/ was automatically redirecting to /login, preventing users from seeing the landing page with the "Try for Free" button.

## Root Cause
The project had **TWO CONFLICTING** entry point systems:

### Old System (DELETED - Was Causing The Problem):
- `frontend/src/index.js` → `App.js` → Used `ProtectedRoute.jsx` + `AuthContext.js`
- This system wrapped the ENTIRE app in authentication checks
- The `ProtectedRoute` component was calling `isAuthenticated()` function that didn't exist
- This caused immediate redirect to /login for all unauthenticated users

### New System (NOW ACTIVE ✅):
- `frontend/src/index.tsx` → `App.tsx` 
- Has proper landing page without forced authentication
- Allows users to view homepage and click "Try for Free"
- Only requires authentication for protected dashboard routes

## Files Deleted
1. ✅ `frontend/src/index.js` - Conflicted with index.tsx
2. ✅ `frontend/src/App.js` - Conflicted with App.tsx  
3. ✅ `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js` - Not used by new system
4. ✅ `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Causing redirect loop

## Expected Behavior Now
1. ✅ Homepage loads at "/" without authentication required
2. ✅ Users see landing page with "Try for Free" and "Login" buttons
3. ✅ "Try for Free" button sets up demo mode and shows dashboard
4. ✅ "Login" button navigates to login page
5. ✅ Dashboard and protected routes only accessible when authenticated

## Verification Steps
After Vercel redeploys (automatic after these commits):

1. Visit https://ledgerlink.vercel.app/
2. Should see the landing page (NOT redirect to /login)
3. Click "Try for Free" - should enter demo mode
4. Click "Login" - should navigate to login page

## Technical Details
The build system was picking up `index.js` instead of `index.tsx` because:
- Both files existed in `frontend/src/`
- JavaScript files (.js) sometimes take precedence over TypeScript (.tsx) in build configurations
- The old `index.js` imported the old `App.js` which had the broken authentication flow

## Resolution
By removing the old conflicting files, Vercel will now:
- Use `index.tsx` as the entry point
- Load `App.tsx` which has the correct routing logic
- Display the landing page without forced authentication
- Only require login for protected dashboard routes

**Status:** FIXED ✅
**Commits:** 
- 45d786d - Remove old index.js
- 66045f9 - Remove old App.js
- ee012c6 - Remove old AuthContext.js
- 46cf6e4 - Remove old ProtectedRoute.jsx

**Next Steps:** 
Wait for Vercel to automatically redeploy (usually 1-2 minutes), then verify the homepage loads correctly.
