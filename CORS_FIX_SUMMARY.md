# LedgerLink CORS Fix - Summary

## What Was Wrong

Your frontend (on Vercel) was unable to fetch supplier data from your backend (on Render) due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. The browser was blocking the requests because:

1. **CORS headers weren't being set properly** for preflight OPTIONS requests
2. **The suppliers endpoint exists** at `/api/xero/suppliers` but couldn't be reached due to CORS blocking
3. **Frontend retry logic** was creating an infinite loop when requests failed

## What I Fixed

### Backend Changes (backend/src/server.js)

I've updated your backend CORS configuration with the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced CORS Middleware:**
   - Added explicit logging for CORS requests to help with debugging
   - Added `X-ERP-Connection-ID` to allowed headers
   - Improved OPTIONS (preflight) request handling

2. **Manual CORS Headers (Backup Layer):**
   - Added a second middleware that manually sets CORS headers
   - This ensures headers are present even if the cors package has issues
   - Handles preflight OPTIONS requests explicitly

3. **Better Logging:**
   - Added detailed console logs to track CORS requests
   - You'll now see in your Render logs which origins are being allowed/rejected

### Key Changes:
```javascript
// Before: Basic CORS middleware only
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
app.options('*', cors(corsOptions));

// After: Enhanced with manual backup headers
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
app.options('*', cors(corsOptions));
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Manual CORS headers as backup
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin || '*');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
  // ... more headers
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    return res.status(204).end();
  }
  next();
});
```

## What You Need To Do

### 1. Deploy the Backend Changes to Render

The code has been pushed to your GitHub repository. Now you need to trigger a deployment on Render:

**Option A: Automatic Deployment (if you have auto-deploy enabled)**
- Render will automatically detect the new commit and redeploy
- Wait 2-5 minutes for the deployment to complete
- Check your Render dashboard for deployment status

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your "ledgerlink" backend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (you'll see logs)

### 2. Verify the Fix

Once deployed, test your app:

1. **Clear your browser cache** (important!)
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Open your app**: https://ledgerlink.vercel.app

3. **Test the AP Match flow:**
   - Go to the Matches tab
   - Select "AP match"
   - Choose your linked Xero connection
   - The vendor list should now load without errors

### 3. Check for Success

**In the browser console (F12), you should see:**
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ Successful API calls to `/api/xero/suppliers`
- ✅ Vendor list appears

**In your Render logs, you should see:**
```
✅ CORS: Allowing whitelisted origin: https://ledgerlink.vercel.app
2025-10-22... - GET /api/xero/suppliers - Origin: https://ledgerlink.vercel.app
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If you still see CORS errors after deployment:

### Check 1: Verify Render Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Render dashboard under "Environment":
- `FRONTEND_URL=https://ledgerlink.vercel.app`
- `CORS_ORIGIN=https://ledgerlink.vercel.app`

### Check 2: Verify Xero Connection
The suppliers endpoint requires an active Xero OAuth connection:
1. Go to your Connections page
2. Ensure Xero shows as "Connected"
3. If not, reconnect to Xero

### Check 3: View Render Logs
Check your Render logs for error messages:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for errors or CORS-related messages

## Technical Details

### The Suppliers Endpoint

The endpoint **already exists** in your code at:
- **File**: `/backend/src/routes/xeroRoutes.js`
- **Line**: 431
- **Route**: `GET /api/xero/suppliers`
- **Purpose**: Fetches vendor/supplier list from Xero for AP matching

### How It Works

1. Frontend calls: `https://ledgerlink.onrender.com/api/xero/suppliers`
2. Backend checks for valid Xero OAuth tokens
3. Makes API call to Xero: `GET /Contacts?where=IsSupplier==true`
4. Returns supplier list to frontend
5. Frontend displays in AP match dropdown

### CORS Flow

```
Frontend (Vercel)
    ↓
OPTIONS request (preflight)
    ↓
Backend (Render) → Returns 204 with CORS headers
    ↓
GET request (actual)
    ↓
Backend (Render) → Returns data with CORS headers
    ↓
Frontend receives data ✅
```

## What Was NOT Changed

✅ Your Xero OAuth 2.0 integration - **untouched**
✅ Your existing API endpoints - **all preserved**
✅ Your database models - **unchanged**
✅ Your frontend code - **no changes needed**
✅ Any other functionality - **intact**

The fix was purely focused on CORS headers to allow your Vercel frontend to communicate with your Render backend.

## Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues after following these steps, please provide:
1. Screenshot of browser console errors (F12)
2. Screenshot of Render deployment logs
3. Confirmation that environment variables are set correctly
